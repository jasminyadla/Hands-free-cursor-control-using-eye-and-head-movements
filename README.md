Overview
Hands-Free Cursor Control Using Eye and Head Movements is a system that enables control of a computer cursor using eye and head movements, leveraging the capabilities of OpenCV. 
A camera tracks the movements of the eyes and head, which are processed in real-time to interpret specific actions.
The system allows for cursor movement in all four directions and scrolling, all controlled based on the user's eye and head movements. 
By translating these movements into corresponding cursor commands, the system offers a hands-free, intuitive interface.
This approach significantly enhances accessibility for individuals with disabilities, providing an efficient and natural way for users to interact with their computers without the need for traditional input devices like a mouse or keyboard.
